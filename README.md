üè† House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting house prices based on various property features such as carpet area, location, number of bedrooms (BHK), balconies, bathrooms, and more.

A Random Forest Regressor model is implemented to estimate house prices using these features. After extensive preprocessing, feature engineering, and model tuning, the model achieved an accuracy of approximately 75% on test data.
